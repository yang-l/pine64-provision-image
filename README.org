#+TITLE: Provision Pine64 Image
#+OPTIONS: toc:2 num:nil

This code is based / modified / taken from [[https://github.com/umiddelb/z2d][umiddelb/z2d]] and [[https://github.com/longsleep/build-pine64-image][longsleep/build-pine64-image]] to create base images for Pine64.

The code is developed and tested under Centos7 / Debian8. There should no need to install any extra software.

Currently, it only generates a headless Debian 8 image with only ssh-server installed on it.
