#+TITLE: Provision Pine64 Image
#+OPTIONS: toc:2 num:nil

Some of this code is based / modified / taken from [[https://github.com/umiddelb/z2d][umiddelb/z2d]] and [[https://github.com/longsleep/build-pine64-image][longsleep/build-pine64-image]] to create base images for Pine64.

The code here is only for fun, and may be used later by my personal projects. And it is made by some quick and dirty hacks.

The code is developed and tested under Gentoo / Centos7 / Debian8 (x86 64bit). No extra software should be required here.

There will be no HDMI / Audio / DE build-in (as need of them and can reduce image size), but any required packages can be installed later manually.

Currently, it only generates a headless Debian 8 image with only ssh-server installed on it.

Usage -

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
bash debian-base.sh
#+END_SRC

Output is under =output/pine64.img=.
