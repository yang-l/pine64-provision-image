#+TITLE: Provision Pine64 Image
#+OPTIONS: toc:2 num:nil

Some of this code is based / modified / taken from [[https://github.com/umiddelb/z2d][umiddelb/z2d]] and [[https://github.com/longsleep/build-pine64-image][longsleep/build-pine64-image]] to create base images for Pine64.

The code here is only for fun, and may be used for my later projects. This is made by quick and dirty hacks.

The code is developed and tested under Gentoo / Centos7 / Debian8 (x86 64bit). No extra software should be required here.

There is no HDMI & serial console & audio output / DE build-in (as no need any of them and willing to reduce image size), but any required packages can be installed later via package manager or manually.

Currently, it only generates a headless Debian 8 image with only ssh-server installed on it.

Usage -

Require root or sudo to run

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
bash debian-base.sh
#+END_SRC

Output is under =output/pine64.img=.
