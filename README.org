#+TITLE: Provision Pine64 Image
#+OPTIONS: toc:2 num:nil

This code is based / modified / taken from [[https://github.com/umiddelb/z2d][umiddelb/z2d]] and [[https://github.com/longsleep/build-pine64-image][longsleep/build-pine64-image]] to create base images for Pine64.

The code here is only for fun, and may be used later for my own projects. This project is made from quick and dirty hacks.

The code is developed and tested under Gentoo / Centos7 / Debian8 (X86 64bit architecture). There should no need to install any extra software.

Currently, it only generates a headless Debian 8 image with only ssh-server installed on it.
